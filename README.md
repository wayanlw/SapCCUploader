# SapCCUploader
Uploading the CC budgets and forecast to SAP is a tedious task. You have to 
1. copy paste the information
2. Clean the data in a prescribed format
3. Create a text file
4. Then only you can upload using the Tx. code KP06

Thought the process looks simple, when you are managing multiple cost centres this becomes a monotonous and boring task. I created this xlsm file to automate the process. File has three functions. 

1. Clear the range (If you already have the previous data)
2. Format data to the sap format
3. Create a tab de-limited txt file in the same folder with the name that you assign.

### How to use
Easy way 
- Download the SAP CC Uploader.xlsm and start using it. 

If you want to do some customizations
- Download the bas file and change it to your need.
